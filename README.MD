# Fortress Royale

Fortress Royale is a free-for-all battle royale gamemode for Team Fortress 2. Parachute into the battlefield, collect loot, and fight up to 31 other players to be the last one standing.

## Requirements

* SourceMod 1.11+
* [nosoop/SM-TFEconData](https://github.com/nosoop/SM-TFEconData)
* [FlaminSarge/tf2attributes](https://github.com/FlaminSarge/tf2attributes)
* [TF2-DMB/CBaseNPC](https://github.com/TF2-DMB/CBaseNPC)
* [Mikusch/friendly-fire](https://github.com/Mikusch/friendly-fire) (optional, highly recommended)

## History

Fortress Royale was originally created by me ([Mikusch](https://github.com/Mikusch)) and [42](https://github.com/FortyTwoFortyTwo) in February 2019, based on the
map [Arena Battleroyal](https://tf2maps.net/downloads/arena-battleroyal.6843/), which was submitted for the TF2Maps 72hr Jam 2018.

Development on the gamemode seized in November 2021 due to countless technical issues and an increasingly unmaintainable code base, and the repository was archived shortly after.

In early 2023, I decided to rewrite the plugin from the ground up, to release as major version 2.0.0.

## Documentation

Due to the great customizability of the gamemode, all documentation will reside in the [wiki](https://github.com/Mikusch/fortress-royale/wiki). If the information you are looking for is missing, incomplete or outdated, feel free to
